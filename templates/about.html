                    <h3><span class="text-font">Our story</span></h3>
                    <p class="text-font">In December of 2014 we bought the domain name AquariumGenius.
                                        Since then, thousands of words have been written to answer questions and the website has been growing steadily.
                                        More and more people read our articles every single day. The site provides information to people on a daily basis.
                                        Bart Sprenkels started the business after learning a ton about aquariums and wanting to share the obtained knowledge with others.
                                        Using the internet it was possible to reach a large audience in an incredibly user friendly way. Using mostly Google,
                                        readers are able to find just exactly what they are looking for without much effort. While the site experienced a slow start,
                                        around the summer of 2019 some articles started to gain traction in Google and were climbing in the search results.
                                        This was perfect! More people were able to find the website, and a lot of people spend some time on the website to find what they are looking for.
                                        In the last months of 2019, we decided to expand. Hopefully, in the start of 2020 more experienced writers will
                                        join Aquarium Genius to provide more information for all aquarium owners.</p>
